# n8n-nodes-tidb-cloud

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use TiDB Cloud in your n8n workflows.

[TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/) is a fully-managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) that brings everything great about TiDB to your cloud and lets you focus on your applications, not the complexities of your database.

## Usage

Here is an example usage, click [here](./doc/example_usage.md) to find more information.

## Fields Description

- **Credential for TiDB Cloud API**: Only supports TiDB Cloud API key authentication. Refer to [Get TiDB Cloud API Key](#prerequisites-get-tidb-cloud-api-key).
- **Project**: The TiDB Cloud project name.
- **Operation**: The operation of this node. Refer to [Support Operation](#support-operation).
- **Cluster**: The TiDB Cloud cluster name. Enter one name for your new cluster.
- **Region**: The region name. Choose a region where your cluster will be deployed. Usually, choose the region closest to your application deployment.
- **Password**: The password of TiDB Cloud cluster.
- **User**: The username of your TiDB Cloud cluster.
- **Database**: The database name.
- **SQL**: The SQL statement to execute.
- **Table**: The table name. You can use `From list` mode to choose one or `Name` mode to type table name manually.
- **Delete Key**: The Name of the item's property which decides which rows in the database should be deleted. Item is the data sent from one node to another. A node performs its action on each item of incoming data. For more information about item in n8n, see [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/items/).
- **Update Key**: The name of the item's property which decides which rows in the database should be updated. Item is the data sent from one node to another. A node performs its action on each item of incoming data. For more information about item in n8n, see [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/items/).
- **Columns**: The comma-separated list of the input item which should used as columns for the rows to update.

## Limitations

1. Normally only one SQL statement is allowed in the **Execute SQL** operation. If you want to execute more than one statement in a single operation, you need to manually enable [`tidb_multi_statement_mode`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/system-variables#tidb_multi_statement_mode-new-in-v4011).
2. The **Delete** and **Update** operation need to specify one field as a key. For example, the `Delete Key` is set to `id`, which is equivalent to executing `delete from table where id = ${item.id}`. Currently, it only supports specifying one key.
3. The **Insert** and **Update** operation need to specify the comma-separated list in the **Columns** field, and the field name must be the same as the input item's property.
